Using [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/) ([docs](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/)) 

Implementing the algorithm described by "Wherefore Art Thou R3579X? Anonymized Social Networks, Hidden Patterns, and Structural Steganography" by Lars Backstrom, Cynthia Dwork, and Jon Kleinberg

Applying and improving this algorithm to work with datasets representing a social network with "weighted" edges:

* [Bitcoin OTC](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinotc.html)

* [Bitcoin Alpha](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoinalpha.html)

* (looking for additional datasets....)
